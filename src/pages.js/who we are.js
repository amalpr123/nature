<h1><b>WHO WE ARE</b></h1>
<p style={{color:"black"}}><b>In today's society, the disconnect between people and nature seems to be clearer and bigger than ever. Connected Planet Foundation was set up to address this ever-growing disconnect. If we want people to protect the natural world, then we need people to connect to it.<br/><br/> Our goal is to build that connection by providing a range of different experiences and opportunities that will not only connect people to the planet, but to themselves and each other. Happy people for a happy planet.We believe everyone has the right to connect with the natural world around them, whatever their background.<br/><br/> For too long communities around the world have been excluded from 'conservation areas' to make way for expensive safari experiences for people across the globe. Communities that border places like the the Kruger National Park having never seen the wonders on the other side of the fence.<br/><br/>  We aim to change that.As well as community conservation events here in the UK, we also sponsor conservation field trips for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who wouldn't otherwise have the chance. Giving them the opportunity to experience the wonders of the natural world, as well as giving them a platform to help protect it.
