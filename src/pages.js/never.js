      <p style={{color:"black"}}><b>Connected Planet have been working in partnership with Semadep Foundation in the Mara Region of Kenya, since 2021. This project started with a field trip into the Maasai Mara National Reserve for 50 children of Semadep School - a school that is located around 3km from Sekenani Gate - and has now blossomed into conservation clubs at three schools. We are proud to fund the work of local field guide and environmental educator, Sopia Luka, and he currently delivers weekly conservation club sessions at Semadep School, Sekenani School and Olochura School. In addition to the lessons, field trips into the Mara and local conservation centres are arranged throughout the year to give the children a chance to connect with wildlife first-hand, whilst learning the importance of protecting it. For many, it is their first chance to visit the world famous wildlife reserve on their doorstep.</b> </p>

      <h1><b>why this so important</b></h1>
      <p style={{color:"black"}}><b>Human populations in the Mara are rising rapidly, which has resulted in an increase in the number of cases of human-wildlife conflict. A herd of elephants can destroy a farmers crops in one night, whilst livestock can often fall victim to predation by wildlife such as lions or leopards. When events like this happen, farmers sometimes seek revenge, spearing or poisoning wildlife that can result in the death of that animal.</b> </p>
