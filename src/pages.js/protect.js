      <p style={{color:"black"}}><b>Many children in South Africa have never visited a game reserve or National Park before. This is despite lots of them living in close proximity to these incredible places, all over the country. Although tourists come from all over the world to see wildlife such as lions, elephants and rhinos, many South Africans will never get that chance.Connected Planet Foundation, Dogs4Wildlife and the IFPCP have launched a brand new conservation club for the pupils at Glen Park Primary school. Siyafunda Ngemvelo, which means we learn in nature in isiZulu has already seen 60 pupils from Glen Park visit Bonamanzi for the first time. The children were able to see wildlife such as elephants and rhinos for the first time in their lives</b></p>
